# CS-305- Journal 

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address? 
Artemis Financial is a company that is looking to provide financial services through individualized financial plans such as savings, retirement, investment and insurance for its customers. They aim to modernize its security operations that identify any security vulnerabilities with the help of Global Rain company. The focus of our partnership is for Artemis Financial to be secure in transferring data and prevent unauthorized users from gaining access.

•	What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
When I finally understood how to do the dependency check that became one of my favor things to do. It was easy to identify what vulnerabilities the code had and what they were. It is important to code securely because it ensures that there are no weak points in the code that will cause hackers to infiltrate the system. Software security gives a company credibility and ensures that they customer information is being protected and making sure that there are not information leaks.

•	Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 
I did not have a problem with the vulnerability assessment, but it was helpful to learn how to identify them in a project. For example, if I want to create a app, I want to make sure it is secure for my customers and identify any vulnerabilities it could possibly happen. This would be a great lesson of how to do that.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 
To increase layers of security I created an SSL certificate that helps provide encrypted connections when sending information.

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 
After refactoring my code, I ran the program again to see if any new vulnerabilities appeared and how to fix them if needed.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? 
Since this will be my portfolio, I can use this as a reference to help me check other future assignments and aid me in my career path.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I can show future employers that I understand the vulnerability in code and what is needed to prevent them. It will showcase my skills of understanding.
